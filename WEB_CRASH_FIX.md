# Web Server Crash Fix

## Problem Analysis

The "Guru Meditation Error: Core 1 panic'ed (LoadProhibited)" indicates a memory access violation when serving the web page from external sources. This is typically caused by:

1. **PROGMEM Access Issues**: Improper handling of PROGMEM strings
2. **Memory Corruption**: Stack overflow or heap corruption
3. **AsyncWebServer Buffer Issues**: Problems with large HTML content

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Safer PROGMEM Handling
- Changed from `request->send_P()` to `request->beginResponse_P()`
- Added proper response headers and error checking
- Added exception handling around web serving

### 2. Memory Monitoring
- Added heap memory debugging
- Added watchdog feeding in main loop
- Added periodic memory status checks

### 3. Connection Safety
- Added "Connection: close" header to prevent keep-alive issues
- Added proper error responses for failed requests

## Testing the Fix

After uploading the new firmware:

1. **Monitor Serial Output**: Watch for memory status and error messages
2. **Test Local Access**: Verify http://[ESP_IP] works from local network
3. **Test External Access**: Try accessing from external sources
4. **Check Memory**: Monitor "Free heap" messages in serial output

## If Issues Persist

### Alternative Solution: String-based HTML

If PROGMEM issues continue, we can convert the HTML to a String-based approach:

```cpp
// In web_server.cpp handleRoot function:
void HunterWebServer::handleRoot(AsyncWebServerRequest *request) {
    // Copy PROGMEM to String to avoid memory access issues
    String htmlContent = String(FPSTR(index_html));
    request->send(200, "text/html", htmlContent);
}
```

### Memory Optimization Options

1. **Reduce HTML Size**: Minimize CSS/JavaScript
2. **Chunked Response**: Split large HTML into smaller chunks
3. **External Storage**: Move HTML to SPIFFS/LittleFS

### Debug Commands

Add these to serial monitor for debugging:
```cpp
Serial.println("ESP32 Info:");
Serial.println("Chip Model: " + String(ESP.getChipModel()));
Serial.println("Free Heap: " + String(ESP.getFreeHeap()));
Serial.println("Heap Size: " + String(ESP.getHeapSize()));
Serial.println("Free PSRAM: " + String(ESP.getFreePsram()));
```

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- **Serial Output**: Should show memory info and successful page serving
- **No Crashes**: ESP32 should remain stable during external access
- **Proper Responses**: Web requests should complete without reboots

Monitor the serial output for:
- "Web page sent successfully" - indicates successful serving
- "Free heap: [number]" - should remain above 10,000 bytes
- "WARNING: Low heap memory" - if this appears, we need further optimization
