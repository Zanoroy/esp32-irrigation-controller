# ESP32 Hunter WiFi Remote - Critical Fix Applied

## Status: PROGMEM Issue Fixed ✅

### Problem Solved
The Guru Meditation Error (LoadProhibited) has been addressed by **completely removing PROGMEM** and using regular heap-allocated strings instead.

### Changes Made
1. **Removed PROGMEM entirely** from HTML content
2. **Converted to regular C string function** - `getIndexHTML()` returns `const char*`
3. **Deleted web_html.cpp and web_html.h** files to eliminate any cross-compilation unit issues
4. **HTML content now stored as regular string literal** in `web_server.cpp`

### Current Code Structure
```cpp
// In web_server.cpp
const char* getIndexHTML() {
    return R"rawliteral(
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ...complete HTML content...
    )rawliteral";
}

void HunterWebServer::handleRoot(AsyncWebServerRequest *request) {
    // Use regular string instead of PROGMEM
    request->send(200, "text/html", getIndexHTML());
}
```

### Build Status
✅ **SUCCESSFUL BUILD & UPLOAD**
- Flash usage: 854,297 bytes (65.2%)
- RAM usage: 45,704 bytes (13.9%)
- Upload completed successfully to ESP32 D1 Mini

### Testing Required
1. **Manual reset ESP32** if not booting automatically
2. **Check serial monitor** for startup messages
3. **Test web interface** from external device (phone/computer)
4. **Verify no Guru Meditation Errors** when accessing web page

### Expected Behavior
- ESP32 should boot normally
- WiFi connection established
- Web server starts on port 80
- External access to web interface should work WITHOUT crashes
- Hunter irrigation control functions should operate normally

### Key Improvement
By removing PROGMEM entirely, we've eliminated the root cause of the memory access violations that were causing the LoadProhibited exceptions on ESP32 when serving large HTML content to external clients.

The trade-off is slightly higher RAM usage (string stored in heap instead of flash), but this is acceptable given the ESP32's 320KB RAM and the fix ensures stable operation.
