# ESP-WROOM-32 Debug Status - End of Day

## Issue: Guru Meditation Error PERSISTS

Despite removing PROGMEM entirely and converting to regular heap strings, the LoadProhibited crashes are still occurring when accessing the web interface from external sources.

## Attempts Made Today:
1. ‚ùå Cross-compilation unit PROGMEM fix (moved HTML to web_server.cpp)
2. ‚ùå Function wrapper approach with getIndexHTML()
3. ‚ùå Complete PROGMEM removal (converted to regular const char*)
4. ‚ùå Deleted web_html files entirely

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Firmware builds and uploads successfully (854KB, 65.2% flash)
- ‚úÖ ESP-WROOM-32 board configuration correct (esp32doit-devkit-v1)
- ‚ùå Web server still crashes on external access

## Tomorrow's Investigation Plan:
1. **Different web server library** - Try ESP32WebServer instead of ESPAsyncWebServer
2. **Chunked response** - Break HTML into smaller pieces
3. **SPIFFS/LittleFS** - Store HTML in filesystem instead of memory
4. **Memory debugging** - Add more detailed heap/stack monitoring
5. **ESPAsyncWebServer version** - Try different version or alternative library
6. **HTML size reduction** - Minimize HTML to test if size is the issue

## Key Insight:
The issue appears deeper than PROGMEM - likely related to ESPAsyncWebServer library handling of large responses or ESP32 memory management during external HTTP requests.

## Files Changed Today:
- src/web_server.cpp (HTML moved inline, PROGMEM removed)
- Deleted: src/web_html.cpp, include/web_html.h
- Added: FIX_APPLIED.md, PROGMEM_FIX_SOLUTION.md

Good night! We'll solve this tomorrow with a fresh approach. üåô
