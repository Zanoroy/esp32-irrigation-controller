# ESP-WROOM-32 Basic Web Server Test

## Status: Basic Version Uploaded âœ…

### Changes Made
1. **Simplified HTML** - Replaced complex irrigation control HTML with minimal test page
2. **Removed all REST endpoints** - Only serving root page `/`
3. **Basic debugging** - Added clear serial output for testing

### Current Web Server Setup
- **Root page**: Simple "ESP32 Basic Test Page"
- **Size**: 838,837 bytes (64.0% flash) - reduced from 854KB
- **Endpoints**: Only `/` (root) and 404 handler
- **No REST API** - all irrigation control removed for testing

### Test Plan
1. **Check serial monitor** - Look for WiFi connection and server startup
2. **Access from same network**: `http://ESP32_IP/`
3. **Access from external device** - phone/computer on same WiFi
4. **Monitor for crashes** - Watch for Guru Meditation Errors

### Expected Serial Output
```
HTTP server started on port 80 - BASIC MODE
Only serving basic test page at http://ESP32_IP/
```

### Basic HTML Content
- Simple title: "ESP32 Basic Test Page"
- Minimal JavaScript (just shows current time)
- No complex CSS or interactive elements
- Total size: ~300 bytes vs ~5KB original

### If This Works
- Issue is with **complex HTML content** or **REST endpoints**
- We can gradually re-add features

### If This Still Crashes
- Issue is with **ESPAsyncWebServer library itself**
- Need to try alternative web server (ESP32WebServer)
- Or investigate deeper ESP32 memory/network issues

### Next Steps (if basic works)
1. Add simple REST endpoint
2. Add basic styling
3. Gradually rebuild irrigation controls
4. Test each addition for crashes

Ready to test! Reset the ESP-WROOM-32 and check serial monitor.
